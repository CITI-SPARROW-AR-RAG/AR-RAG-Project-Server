The main door is shot bolted shut and can only be opened once the spindle is stationary and there is no program running. The tool changer carousel door can only be opened after pressing the soft key on the control panel. Once this has been done the operator must then turn the selector switch to \" 1 \" at the carousel load position which will then allow the door to open. At this time the carousel will not rotate.\\n\\nPower On Safety Circuit (Allows the operator to execute certain tasks whilst the front door is open)\\n\\nLimited machine functionality is available to the operator whilst the main door is open. This is achieved by turning the key switch to position \" 1 \". This then allows the handwheel and jog keys to move the machine axes at feed rates of $2 \\\\mathrm{~m} / \\\\mathrm{min}$ and less.

      "\n",
      "It is the customer's responsibility to ensure the machine is installed in a safe operating position, with all service pipes and cables clear of the operation area so as not to cause a hazard. Access must be allowed for safe maintenance, swarf and oil disposal including safe stacking of machined and un-machined components.\n",
      "# 1.2.2 Machine guarding \n",
      "\n",
      "This Machine is fitted with completely enclosed guards as standard. In certain cases and tooling applications additional guarding may have to be provided by the user.\n",
      "The standard machine guarding has special safety interlocks on the guard doors that comply with the Machinery Directive. Guards and interlocks must be kept fully maintained and tested by the customer and shall not be removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The guards are made with clear observation windows having high impact resistance to provide operator safety and a clear unobstructed view of the operations in process. The opening of any guard door provides access to potential hazard areas. Opening of the front working area guard doors is not allowed whilst the spindle is rotating but it is still possible to manually initiate axis movements whilst these doors are open albeit at a reduced traverse rate. Extreme care must therefore be used at all times.\n",

The window impact resistance capacity is at $8.39 \\\\mathrm{~kg} . \\\\mathrm{m}$. Any crack on the window is not allowable.\\n\\n### 1.4.4 Door Interlock\\n\\nThe machine has 2 interlocked doors, the main access door at the front of the machine and the tool changer carousel door at the rear. The main door is shot bolted shut and can only be opened once the spindle is stationary and there is no program running. The tool changer carousel door can only be opened after pressing the soft key on the control panel. Once this has been done the operator must then turn the selector switch to \" 1 \" at the carousel load position which will then allow the door to open. At this time the carousel will not rotate.\\n\\nPower On Safety Circuit (Allows the operator to execute certain tasks whilst the front door is open)\\n\\nLimited machine functionality is available to the operator whilst the main door is open.
